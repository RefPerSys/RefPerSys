This plugins_dir/ directory contains C++ code of GPL licensed plugins
should be dlopen(3)-ed. It could contain also shared libraries.

There are two sorts of plugins: those handwritten and those generated.

Several plugins are hand-written, and their C++17 or C++23 code (to be
compiled by the GCC compiler on POSIX operating systems) is
conventionally named rpsplug_*.cc .... Most of them being compiled by
the do-build-refpersys-plugin utility whose C++ code is GPL licensed
and in file do-build-refpersys-plugin.cc

As documented, a plugin named rps_7GIB3ma21I200tfqDs-mod.so
corresponds to the object of id _7GIB3ma21I200tfqDs, that is should be
generated from that object.
